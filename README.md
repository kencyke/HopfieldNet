# HopfieldNet

Some applications of Hopfield Network are deposited in this repository.

## MNIST
It included two files (mnist.py and hopfield4gif.py).
mnist.py provides some functions to get and destroy the MNIST data by using sklearn.
hopfield4gif.py reconstructs the trained MNIST data from the corrupted one, and, moreover, produces 80 png images as the output MNIST data.
They are used to make or embed a gif animation parametrized by the bias term.
