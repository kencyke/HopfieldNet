# HopfieldNet

Some applications of Hopfield Network are deposited in this repository.

## MNIST
It included two files (mnist.py and hopfield4gif.py).
mnist.py provides some functions to get and destroy the MNIST data by using sklearn.
On the other hand, hopfield4gif.py reconstructs the trained MNIST data from the corrupted one, and, moreover, outputs 80 png images.
They are used to make a gif animation parametrized by the bias term.
